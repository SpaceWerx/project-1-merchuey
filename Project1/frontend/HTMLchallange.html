    <p>Hi. My name is Mercedez, but my middle name is sparkey so cool people call me that. I do have a bday but i dont like sharing that information.
        I went to mount saint mary's university where i majored in math. so if you have a math question ask me, and ill google it!
        Though i majored in math, im not very good at it. i just tried my very best because i like puzzles.
